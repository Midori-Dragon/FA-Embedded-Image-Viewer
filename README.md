## Description
This Script embedds the clicked Image (when browsing the gallery) on the current Site instead of opening the whole Page. When anything, except the embedded Image, is clicked it disappears. But I also added a close button in case something goes wrong.

## Features
- Embeddes clicked Image on current Site
- Fav button to Fav or Unfav the image
- Download button
- Simular design as Furaffinity
- Includes author link, so you can still open the authors Gallery
- Compability with [Infini-Gallery](https://greasyfork.org/de/scripts/462632-infini-gallery), [Watches Favorite Viewer](https://greasyfork.org/de/scripts/463464-watches-favorites-viewer-beta) (Watches Favorite Viewer needs to run First)

## Extra
